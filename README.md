# Enron-DataAnalysis
The project  takes a dataset borrowed from Kaggle in the website: 
  https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/enron-email-dataset#emails.csv
which shows 500,000+ emails from aproximatedly 150 employees before the collapse on Enron in 2007. With this information, and being
the main objective of the project, we search using different arrangements of N-grams any related words, sentences, phrases or even 
clue emails which can lead us to the date where the root of the collapse between workers began. 

The reasearch its focused on two main parts. The first is investigating how do people talk to each other when they know that they
are hiding something. Do they use code to talk? or the extreme oposite, do they believe on a secure platform, such as e-mail, could
be enough to talk it out without care? Reading into samples of mail, main topics and extracting information from certain groups of 
people, clasificating by age, sex or other characteristics could give us a hint where to begin sniffing.

The second parts uses a 'hound'. Knowing the profile of workers that we are looking for, the ones with the information that no big
group of workers should know, we can see patterns in their way of writing mails and the people that they talk the most frecuently. 
What we are aiming to is to develop a dictionary, if able, of words that, present on the e-mail, could give us a hint of how many
of them where guilty before the actual date of the collapse came upon them.
